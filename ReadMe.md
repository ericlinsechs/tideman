<br>TIDEMAN</h1>

##  Overview

This repository provides a voting system that executes the [Tideman algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked_pairs). It collects candidate names and voter preferences, evaluates preferences. By recording and sorting preferences by victory strength, it eliminates potential cycles, eradicating bias. Ultimately, the system announces an unbiased election winner.
